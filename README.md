# Paebbl - Automation requirements to support Gwen

Points tackled:

## 1. Dockerfile generation and troubleshooting with python libraries

ðŸŸ¢ Dockerfile adjusted based on meeting with Gwen:

```ruby
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM python:3.10-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /app
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . /app

ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

## 2. How to automate every day work

### Source code updates to `main` branch should build new image

- ðŸŸ¢ Github Actions pipeline should watch changes and trigger the process.

### Python App (Flask) within AWS should be re-deployed with new Docker image

- [Work in progress] Add Github actions steps to deploy Flask app to ECS.

### Notify Platform Team about deployments

- ðŸŸ¢ Github Actions step added for Slack notifications.

## 3. Improvements to Gwen's workflow

Current state:

1. Software relies on CSV file contents to generate results.
2. CSV file `clean.csv` is included **within** Docker image for testing and development purposes.

Improvemennt:

1. Update python app to work with **external** CSV file.
2. **S3 Bucket** provides drag-and-drop UI for colleagues to securely share files there.
